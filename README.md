# Jakarta-Flood-Prediction
Bangkit Capstone Project 2022


As the final project of the Bangkit Academy 2022 program, our team created an application that can detect flooding at Jakarta floodgates, based on the water level against the color meter.
Currently this application combines machine learning and mobile development, in the future the cloud feature will be used to store databases and display them to the public.
